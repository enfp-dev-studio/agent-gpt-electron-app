# AgentGPT Electron App


## Notes

This app is a version of AgentGPT designed for individuals to use in their own local environment. By migrating AgentGPT to an Electron app, users can enjoy the benefits of the AI model on their personal devices without relying on a server-based deployment. We would like to express our gratitude to the AgentGPT team for their valuable work and contributions to the AI community.
